# Will's Password Generator

## Description
Will's Password Generator is a web based password generator that creates a random password based on the user defined criteria. It is a straight forward application with an exceedingly simple UI that consists of the title, a button to instantiate the password generation and a window to display the generated password. 

## Functionality

Despite the simplicity of the UI, this password generator does have some more complex functionality that sets it apart from the most rudimentary password generators. The user is able to choose whether or not to include four different categories of characters - lowercase, uppercase, numeric and special. They are also able to choose how many characters long they would like the password to be between 8 and 128 characters.
